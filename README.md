# AI Data Analyst ‚Äî Insights for Everyone

> Streamlit AI Agent that ingests a CSV, performs cleaning & EDA, runs AI-assisted analysis & visualization, and produces downloadable reports ‚Äî with a one-click ‚ÄúRun Full Analysis‚Äù mode.

This repository contains a production-ready, extensible Streamlit application that implements an autonomous **AI Data Analysis Agent**. It takes user CSVs through a full pipeline (ingest ‚Üí clean ‚Üí EDA ‚Üí user goal ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí visualizations ‚Üí report), and includes safety/UX features such as silent visualization error handling, optional Gemini/OpenAI summarization, and a configurable workflow diagram.

## Features

* Upload CSV files (with file-type & size validation).
* Automated cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, type coercion, datetime detection).
* Exploratory Data Analysis: summary stats, missingness heatmap, correlation matrix.
* AI-assisted analysis & insights (rule-based heuristics + optional Gemini/OpenAI summarization).
* Visualization recommendations and interactive Plotly charts.
* ‚ÄúRun Full Analysis‚Äù ‚Äî single-click pipeline execution.
* Exportable report (HTML / TXT / MD download), with charts embedded as PNGs.
* Configurable flow diagram (load from GitHub raw image URL) shown full-width.
* Silent/safe visualization mode: catches Plotly/plotting errors and hides raw tracebacks from UI.
* Caching for remote images and fast UX.
* Extensible ‚Äî add ML modules (classification, forecasting), PDF reports, or cloud connectors.

## Quick demo

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Shreyas521032/AI-Data-Analyst-Insights-for-everyone.git
cd AI-Data-Analyst-Insights-for-everyone

# Create venv (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# .venv/Scripts/activate    # Windows PowerShell

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py        # or streamlit run app1.py depending on the main file
```

Open the link printed by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) and use the UI to upload a CSV and run the AI Agent.

---

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python packages (see `requirements.txt`):

```
streamlit
pandas
plotly
plotly-express
numpy
scikit-learn
requests
Pillow
google-generativeai    # Gemini integration
anthropic               # optional (if using Anthropic models instead)
```

Install everything with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: `google-generativeai` (Gemini) requires credentials and quota from your Google Cloud/Generative AI project. If you don't have access, the app will still run using the rule-based analysis pipeline and Plotly visualizations.

---

## Install & run (detailed)

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shreyas521032/AI-Data-Analyst-Insights-for-everyone.git
   cd AI-Data-Analyst-Insights-for-everyone
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Configure the Gemini API key (if you want AI summaries):

   * Open the app sidebar and paste your Gemini API key in the `Gemini API Key` field.

---

## Configuration & common options

* **Gemini / Generative AI**

  * Provide your `Gemini` (Google Generative AI) API key in the sidebar. The app initializes `google-generativeai` if a key is present and will call the model to generate analysis summaries and visualization recommendations.
  * If you prefer another provider, the app includes hooks (and optional `anthropic`) to plug in different LLM clients.

* **Flow diagram**

  * The Agent Workflow diagram (Tab: "Agent Workflow") loads an image from a `DEFAULT_FLOW_URL` defined in the code. Use a raw GitHub content URL (raw.githubusercontent.com) or any public image URL.

* **Upload size limit**

  * The sample app checks file size (commonly set to 30‚Äì50 MB). Change the limit constant in the app as needed.

* **Silent visualization errors**

  * The app wraps Plotly creation in a safe plotting helper. Toggle the behavior in code (silent vs friendly warnings). All exceptions are logged server-side.

* **Non-ASCII / emoji issues**

  * If you encounter `SyntaxError: invalid character` for emojis (e.g., ‚ù§Ô∏è), either remove the emoji from the source, replace it with an HTML entity (e.g. `&#10084;`), or save the file as UTF-8. The safest default is to avoid literal emojis in `.py` files.

## How the AI Agent works (overview)

1. **Ingest**: Streamlit file uploader ‚Üí `pd.read_csv()` with fallbacks.
2. **Preprocess**: drop extremely sparse columns, convert numeric strings, detect datetime columns, fill missing values with median/mode.
3. **EDA**: `df.describe()`, numeric distributions, correlation matrix, missingness visualization.
4. **Goal handling**: detect ambiguous goals via heuristics; ask for clarifications or auto-plan.
5. **AI Analysis**: call Gemini (if configured) with dataset context and user objective to obtain JSON visualization recommendations and insights.
6. **Visualize**: generate recommended charts safely with Plotly, embed PNG snapshots into HTML report.
7. **Report**: assemble HTML (safe string building) and serve as downloadable HTML/MD/CSV files.

---

## Troubleshooting & tips

* **Plotly tracebacks in UI**: If you see raw Python tracebacks in Streamlit, update to the safe plotting wrapper included in the code. This logs exceptions and prevents red error boxes from appearing.
* **Gemini API errors**: If generative calls fail, check your API key, network, and quota. The app falls back to rule-based insights if AI calls error out.
* **Large datasets**: For large CSVs, sample the data for EDA or increase memory limits. Consider adding chunked processing or offloading data to cloud storage.
* **Flow image not loading**: Use the raw GitHub URL (`raw.githubusercontent.com/...`) and ensure the file path is correct and publicly accessible.

---

## Extending the app

* Add model training (classification/regression) with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (scikit-learn, XGBoost).
* Add time-series forecasting (Prophet, pmdarima, or deep learning).
* Generate PDF reports (weasyprint, reportlab, or headless Chromium).
* Add authentication & cloud deployment: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or containerized deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure.
* Add a task queue or worker for heavy analyses (Celery/RQ) to avoid blocking Streamlit's single-threaded server.
